### Types of Templates in Terraform for Infrastructure Provisioning

Terraform templates are files written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON, used to define infrastructure as code (IaC). The following are the types of templates commonly used for infrastructure provisioning:

1. **Basic Configuration Templates**  
   - These templates are used for defining simple resources such as:
     - Virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VM, Google Compute Engine).
     - Storage (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure Blob storage).
     - Networking (e.g., VPCs, subnets, security groups).

2. **Module Templates**  
   - Modular templates are reusable pieces of code that can be shared across multiple configurations. These are used for:
     - Grouping multiple resources logically (e.g., a module for a VPC that includes subnets, route tables, and gateways).
     - Standardizing infrastructure configurations.
   - Example: `terraform-aws-vpc` is an AWS VPC module available on the Terraform Registry.

3. **Provider-Specific Templates**  
   - These templates are designed to work with specific cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-prem solutions like VMware. They use provider-specific blocks.
   - Example: Defining an AWS Lambda function with the `aws_lambda_function` resource.

4. **Dynamic Templates**  
   - Dynamic blocks and variables allow for creating templates that adapt to varying inputs. These are useful for:
     - Dynamically generating multiple resources (e.g., multiple subnets or EC2 instances).
     - Parameterized configurations with variables and conditional expressions.

5. **Multi-Environment Templates**  
   - These templates use workspaces or variable files to manage different environments (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`).
   - Commonly implemented using separate `terraform.tfvars` files for each environment.

6. **Data Source Templates**  
   - Data sources allow you to fetch information about existing infrastructure resources. These templates are used when:
     - Referring to already-deployed resources.
     - Querying data dynamically (e.g., fetching the AMI ID for the latest Ubuntu image).

7. **Remote Backend Templates**  
   - These are used to store the Terraform state in remote backends such as S3, Azure Blob, or Terraform Cloud. It helps in team collaboration and ensures state file safety.

8. **Custom Templates with External Scripts**  
   - Sometimes Terraform integrates with external scripts (e.g., Python, Bash) for handling complex logic or bootstrapping.

9. **Provisioner Templates**  
   - These templates use Terraform provisioners to execute commands on resources after they're created. For example:
     - Running a Bash script to install software on a VM.
     - Configuring the infrastructure with tools like Ansible.

10. **Security-Focused Templates**  
    - These templates include security best practices such as:
      - Encrypting data at rest (e.g., enabling encryption for S3 buckets or EBS volumes).
      - Managing IAM roles, policies, and access control.
